Volleyball Rotation Tracker
===========================

(No screenshot, since my website is temporarily down, and I don't want to be linking stuff to my temporary site.)

A volleyball rotation (and score and server) tracker.

### Usage

The usage is actually on the page, but I'm going to copy&paste it here anyway for ease.


- Input the player numbers from the lineup directly into the player lists on the leftmost and rightmost sides of this app.
- Click the "On Court!" buttons for either team to view their lineup visually on the diagram/court.
- Tick the "Serving" box to designate the first serving team.
- Click "+1" on the corresponding team's side when they get a point. The rotation and score will be tracked for you.
- If you have made a mistake, click the "Undo" button to undo the last action. Previous actions may be undone as well. 

### Requirements

- Web browser with JavaScript capabilities. (I actually designed this in a size that wouldn't look bad on a smartphone.)

### Where to try

- http://amanokami.net/projects/vball-rotation2.html (This is where it usually will be, but for now, it's down.)
- http://home.amanokami.net/vball-rotation2.html (This is the temporary place it will be hosted. Since this server has dynamic IP, the availability may flicker.)

### Comments

I made this originally in the winter of 2013 (http://amanokami.net/project/vball-rotation.html), since I was managing (girls!) volleyball for the past season, and keeping track of the rotations on the scorebook was difficult. (Since it was linear)
However, in that version you still basically kept track of the rotations yourself, only that it was visualized, since each team rotated independently, and you could unrotate them independently, so it didn't make a difference.

So, I made this version, right before the 2014 volleyball season, now with all these new features:
- Score tracker
- Server tracker
- Automatically rotates and gives points, so all you have to do is add points
- Undo function! 

Now I just need to add a viewer of how the game went.

Oh, and when I make JS webapps I prefer to keep them in one page, so that's why that's the only file there.

### TODOs

- Log exporting and visualizing the game flow.
